# Introduction

ZeroConfig CLI is a set of CLI tools, written in PHP, that require zero
configuration in order to function.

# Installation

To install the code base on which the tools are built, as a library:

```
composer require zero-config/cli
```

Alternatively, if you are only interested in using the CLI tools:

```
composer global require zero-config/cli
```

# Downloads

The tools are also available as pre-built executables:
